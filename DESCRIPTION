Description: Performs Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) Regression for
        covariance matrix outcomes. The method identifies the optimal
        projection direction which maximizes the log-likelihood
        function of the log-linear heteroscedastic regression model in
        the projection space. See Zhao et al. (2018), Covariate
        Assisted Principal Regression for Covariance Matrix Outcomes,
        <doi:10.1101/425033> for details.
