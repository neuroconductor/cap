Description: Performs Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) Regression for covariance matrix outcomes. The method identifies the optimal projection direction which maximizes the log-likelihood function of the log-linear heteroscedastic regression model in the projection space. See Zhao et al. (2018), Covariate Assisted Principal Regression for Covariance Matrix Outcomes, <doi:10.1101/425033> for details.
